# Rock_Paper_Scissors_NewbieMode
Just building Rock Paper Scissors in JavaScript

It works as intended, but there are still things to do:

- Animate hover on option;
- Animate click on option;
- Implement a restart function;
- Design the page to be prettier;
- Clean/organize code.

In this project I wanted to aply what i learned about:

- Event listeners;
- Creating and calling functions.
